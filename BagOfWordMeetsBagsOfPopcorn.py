# Bag-of-words model - Wikipedia
# Let's suppose there are 2 sentences below
# (1) John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.
# (2) John also likes to watch football games.

# I tokenize above 2 sentences, and put them into bags, then it seems like below
# [
#     "John",
#     "likes",
#     "to",
#     "watch",
#     "movies",
#     "Mary",
#     "too",
#     "also",
#     "football",
#     "games"
# ]

# And I count how many times each token shows up in the bag in order from top to bottom
# (1) John:1, likes:2, ... =>  [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
# (2) [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]
# Above processing is the process of converting the formation of data to make the machine learning algorithm understand data

# I put "bag of words" in the "bigram" way by n-gram methodology, and it's shown below
# [
#     "John likes",
#     "likes to",
#     "to watch",
